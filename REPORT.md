## No Pretraining vs Pretraining

### No Pretraining

| Configuration | Test Accuracy | Best Train Accuracy | Best Validation Accuracy | Training Time |
|----|------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| 1  | 55.4%      | 47.98%              | 41.54%                   | 329.9 min     |
| 2  | 54.91%     | 97.74%              | 54.02%                   | 366.7 min     |

**Achieved 55.4% accuracy on CIFAR-100 without pretraining.**

#### Configuration 1:

- It was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 128, using ResNet18 without pretraining. 
- The optimization was performed using SGD with momentum 0.9, a learning rate of 0.1, and a weight decay of 5e-4. 
- A StepLR scheduler with a step size of 30 and gamma 0.1 controlled the learning rate decay. 
- The model used label smoothing (0.1).
- Data augmentation included RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip, ColorJitter, Cutout, and AutoAugment.
- A batch size scheduler doubled the batch size halfway through training.

## Hyperparameter Sweep

A custom sweep mechanism was implemented using a Python script and TensorBoard. 
Eight predefined configurations were evaluated:


| Config | Model       | Optimizer | LR     | Best Train Accuracy | Best Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Time (min) |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1      | resnet50    | SGD       | 0.1    | 69.18%              | 52.99%                   | 58.73%        | 470.4      |
| 2      | resnet18    | AdamW     | 0.001  | 74.05%              | 46.13%                   | 52.62%        | 234.9      |

| 8      | resnest14d  | SGD       | 0.1    | 71.88%              | 49.30%                   | 56.12%        | 388.6      |


#### Configuration 1:

## Efficiency 

All experiments were executed entirely on CPU, which naturally resulted in significantly longer training times compared to GPU-based setups.

| Config | Model       | Optimizer |  Test Accuracy | Time (min) |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1      | resnet50    | SGD       |  58.73%        | 470.4      |
| 2      | resnet18    | AdamW     |  52.62%        | 234.9      |

The training times varied significantly between configurations (ranging from ~234 minutes to ~470 minutes).
Despite this hardware limitation, the pipeline remained stable and memory-efficient due to 
mixed-precision training (AMP), compiled models, and adaptive batch size scheduling.

## Estimated Score

- Criteria 1: I expect to receive around 8 points, because my pipeline is device-agnostic, supports all required datasets, uses multiple models from timm, includes data augmentation, 
supports all required optimizers and LR schedulers, integrates a batch size scheduler, TensorBoard logging, and early stopping.
- Criteria 2: I expect 5–6 points, because I implemented a custom sweep with TensorBoard, included 8 configurations, described the parameters, and added metrics plots, but none of 
the models reached 70% accuracy on CIFAR-100.
- Criteria 3: I expect 1 point, because I explained efficiency limitations, reported timing measurements, and discussed why CPU slowed training.
- Criteria 4: I expect 1-2 points, because none of the configurations reached the target accuracies, but I included a separte
section in the report where I compared the results for no pretraining and pretraining.
